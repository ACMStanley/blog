For over a decade, the representation of women at senior levels has been on the agenda in the corporate world, and yet women are still underrepresented in UK businesses – with women occupying only 30% of management roles.

That number is worse still in the tech industry, with women occupying just 5% of the top jobs.

This week, I attended 'Women of Silicon Roundabout', the UK's largest tech event for women. There are so many words to describe how fabulous it was to be surrounded by so many other women in my industry. A few that stand out for me are passionate, curious, intelligent, powerful and driven.

Jess McEvoy and I delivered a workshop on 'How to build a business case for your next promotion'.

It was clearly a subject of huge interest with more than 100 women attending. So I wanted to share some of the content more widely.

Learnings form my career to date:

As you can see this is not a straight up line. I’ve had ups and downs and sideways moves.

The vertical axis shows where I felt my career level was in terms of seniority and progression – not necessarily reflected in the title or position itself.

## Find your people and your place

One of my first jobs in London having re-located. I couldn’t trust this organisation, I couldn’t be part of it. The way they handled a challenging member of staff resulted in instant dismissal. In short, she was my account executive and it transpired she was earning a lot more than me yet at in an entry level role. I didn’t think this was fair and wondered if it was because I was new to the London job market \]. She challenged me on my ability to do my role in our 1-2-1s rather than focusing on her own development. But rather than course correct my salary, or give a justification, they fired her immediately. I was horrified.

With more experience under my belt, I now understand that seniority doesn’t necessarily mean higher salary. Working in multi-disciplinary teams - you cannot compare and really shouldn’t. But the situation exposed me to a place where I didn’t like the culture or the people.

## Mistakes can create opportunities

I suffered what I thought at the time was an impossible to recover from setback, but actually it led me to a whole new sector that felt way more like home and also moved me away from the “finger of blame” culture. I wanted to be where people would help me learn, not ridicule or blame.

I was working on an Annual Report, and It was printed with the wrong phone number - despite it being signed off by all the stakeholders. I was devastated at the time, but learned so much from the situation. I turned my back on design for print - it was too 'final' for me. I wanted to focus on Digital and technology.

## Being invested in made me thrive

I found a place filled with female and male role models I could learn directly from and aspire to be like. They taught me a huge amount and were pivotal in my career. I was empowered and had a really clear purpose.

## Life happens

I moved towns, I had children, my life and career were moving at different speeds. The opportunities in my new city were very limited and I had to take a 50% pay cut and demotion - for the first time in my career I felt trapped in a job I didn’t feel I could excel in. I didn’t feel like my workplace understood or empathised with my new family lifestyle.

When I was pregnant I was ridiculed for the impact it would have on my life. It was only when there was a ‘baby boom’ in the      office that things started to change for the better.

## I didn’t stand still

I re-focused and took my time to find an organisation that matched my values. This was Virgin Money ‘Everybody Better Off’ which I now take with me everywhere I go.

I recently joined Scott Logic, and to help me choose the best fit company for me that was going to fulfill my needs and aspirations, I followed these steps

\*\*Start with asking yourself ‘Why?’.
\*\*

What are your motivations to do this. By asking yourself why you start a process of growth and discovery.

## Map yourself

I created a 'career canvas' to help me map who I am. Drawing inspiration from a well used framework in business called the ‘Business Model Canvas ’. The purpose of this is to give you self awareness, identify strengths and weaknesses and draw out gaps that you have. It’s the building block to your business case.

\*\*Know your direction
\*\*

Think about the direction you want to go in - identify your goals - again this is something that you need to think about when you leave today

\*\*Build your case
\*\*

The Career canvas helped me recognise and act on areas that can be improved. It’s designed to give you focus and self awareness. It also reveals clear paths on which to build your career in a way that fulfills you and your needs and ambition.

This is a framework guide, and the questions can be interpreted in different ways. And that’s okay.

Where there is significant variance between say what you do all day versus what you’re interested in or your skills are, then this tells you either that you have some areas to focus on developing or, you’re in the wrong job.

The Difference between who helps me versus who I need to help shows where I need to expand my area of influence and spend time with some new people.

Sacrifices - this is about identifying your red lines. It’s not a commentary about your choices. It’s about understanding that if there is pressure on something, like job title, salary, remote or in person, travel etc  that you understand where you feel you can be flexible (if at all) and where you can’t. Its personal, there is no right or wrong. But this is about having thought ahead of time, so you aren’t having to answer on the fly or be put on the spot. It's also about thinking about what you sacrifice now and what you are looking to change in that list.

Look at the items you list in what motivates you, and see if your key activities in your role support or hinder your motivations.

There is no right or wrong way of filling it out, but I find doing the central pillar last is easier when you have completed the surrounding ones. The central pillar is your USP, your superpower and what makes you stand out from the crowd.

I researched the companies I was interested in and overlayed their values. It helped me narrow down my choices stack rank them against each other.

This is my canvas with the Scott Logic values overlayed:

The career canvas is just one of the building blocks to help you build your business case for your next promotion. Companies use lots of different frameworks and I think these should be very transparent. Once you have put the thought into the canvas the case should be easy to write. The next step is then preparing for your interview.

Ends.
