Late last year I had the chance to attend [DevTernity](https://devternity.com), an all-remote generalist software development conference. The first day was the main conference day, with the second (optional) day offering a choice of workshops by the speakers. It was a great conference. In this post I'll cover off some points of interest from the talks I chose to attend, and reflect on the remote conference experience.
