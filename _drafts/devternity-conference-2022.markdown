Late last year I had the chance to attend [DevTernity](https://devternity.com), an all-remote generalist software development conference. The first day was the main conference day, with the second (optional) day offering a choice of workshops by the speakers. It was a great conference. In this post I'll cover off some points of interest from the talks I chose to attend, and reflect on the remote conference experience.

# Improving eBay's Development Velocity

Randy Shoup told the story of how at eBay they stepped up to double their engineering productivity, starting from a base of 27 years' worth of grown IT estate and ways of working. They chose to start by focusing on software development and delivery/deployment, as an enabler for possibly later improving other aspects of building and operating software.  Billed as a "velocity initiative", the programme applied aspects of team topologies (platform teams, enabling teams, senior individual contributors) to bring cohorts of feature/product teams into the fold every quarter. Much of the work backlog could be found by asking the question "if you had to deploy every day, why can't you?". Noting that transformation is hard, he used the term "immune system" to describe how a company/organisation naturally and unintentionally tends to fight/resist change.

# Simple and Powerful Things That Work for Me

Jakub Nabrdalik shared some tips about thinking and doing within software development, grouped by before coding, while coding, and after the coding. While some of these would probably be picked up over years of working in software, it was great to see them identified and shared. One that sticks with me is his approaches for implementing something when you can't see far ahead enough to know what the end result looks like, i.e. how not to have coder's block when you're out of the comfort zone of your knowledge and familiar patterns. These were "baby steps", "backward programming", "top-down and layer on the detail", and "learning by chaos". He observes that once you know what you want, it's quick to rewrite rough code that helped you figure that out. Another tip he had was on observability - that if you can't reason about your code or failing tests via logs alone (i.e. you use a debugger), then you won't be able to reason about what's happening in production either.

# The Secrets of the Fastest Java Developers on Earth

Victor Rentea demonstrated his arsenal of tips and tricks for IntelliJ IDEA. He stresses the importance of having unconscious competence of the tool, so menial tasks don't distract or slow down our thinking. This talk conflicted with another I wanted to attend on another track, so I watched this later while pausing occasionally to try things out in my own IDE - which worked well. There was a lot to learn from this one even for seasoned users, covering: typing less, selecting code, inspections, refactoring, and navigation.
