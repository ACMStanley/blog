When writing code, I often think "how do I test this?".

The answer could be one or more of the following:

* Test Driven Development (in which case I should have started already!)

* Unit tests

* Integration tests

* End to end tests

**Test Driven Developement (TDD)**

There are many blog posts out there about TDD so I won't go into great detail here about the concept here other than to say that it id broadly about writing tests before the actual code. The idea being that your tests can help inform exactly what code it is you need to write.

Whether or not to do TDD for me is about how well defined the requirement is, how well do you understand the code you are about to write? To be able to do TDD I think the requirement needs to be well defined and you need to have a good grasp on the concept and the functionality you are going to be writing.

If on the other hand, you have been thrown a requirement that is not very well defined or you are not that familiar with the area in which you are working then there is an argument against TDD and possibly an argument that the requirement is not ready for development.
