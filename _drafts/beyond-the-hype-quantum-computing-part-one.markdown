In this episode – the first of a two-parter – Colin Eberhardt and Oliver Cronk talk to Denis Mandich, CTO of Qrypt, a company that creates quantum-secure encryption products. Denis is also a physicist and has a wealth of knowledge when it comes to Quantum Computing.

Their conversation covers the physics that underpins this technology, including the strange concepts of superposition and entanglement. They cover the practical aspects of cloud-based Quantum Computers and what can be achieved today through circuit design. Finally, they look to the future to discuss the impact this breakthrough technology is likely to have.
